Three Demand Side Management Strategies have been investigated:
- Strategy 1: First come, first serve
- Strategy 2: Lowest Battery charge has priority
- Strategy 3: Equal Distribution

Building upon the EV Charging Model, this work supposes artifical limits are placed on the grid (local substation); 8000kW, 10,000kW, and 12000kW. The three strategies have been modelled to curb EV power demand below these thresholds to understand the implications of each method. The algorithm responsible for this process can be seen below:
